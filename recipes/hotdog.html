    <h2>All-American Hot Dog</h2>
    <p>
      This 'burger dog' is far more than a hot dog-shaped cheeseburger. It's a
      one-handed wonder that's perfectly proportioned and easier to eat than a
      regular cheeseburger.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 slices cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>2 extra long buns</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons mayo</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol class="directions-list">
      <li>
        Place half the ground beef on a sheet of plastic wrap. Pat it into a
        rectangular shape, about 1/2 inch thick, 8 1/2 inches long, and 4 inches
        wide. Season with salt and pepper. Roll the beef into a log, using the
        plastic wrap as a guide. Season with more salt and pepper. Wrap the
        plastic tightly around the log and twist both ends tight. Pat gently to
        slightly flatten. Repeat with remaining ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        Remove the burger dogs from the plastic wrap and place on the grill,
        perpendicular to the grates. Cook until burgers are browned but still
        pink inside, 4 to 5 minutes, flip, and cook another 2 to 3 minutes.
        Place a slice of cheese on each burger dog and grill to medium doneness
        (an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
        least 140 degrees F/60 degrees C). Remove and rest 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast hot dog buns on the grill and spread each with 2 teaspoons
        mayonnaise. Place burger dog on each bun and squirt 1 tablespoon of
        ketchup on top.
      </li>
